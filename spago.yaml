    # The version of your package. This follows semver rules, but with no
    # prereleases - so only major.minor.patch.
    version: 1.0.0
    # The license for your source, in SPDX format: https://spdx.dev/

    # Optional list of globs to include in the published archive, in
    # addition to the list of files that the Registry includes by default:
    # https://github.com/purescript/registry-dev/blob/master/SPEC.md#always-included-files
    # include:
    # - "test/**/*.purs"
    # Optional list of globs to exclude from the published archive, in
    # addition to the list of files that the Registry includes by default:
    # https://github.com/purescript/registry-dev/blob/master/SPEC.md#always-excluded-files
    # Note that the Registry will first apply the `include` list, then
    # the `exclude` one, as detailed in the specification:
    # https://github.com/purescript/registry-dev/blob/master/SPEC.md#33-manifest
    # exclude:
    # - "test/graphs/**/*"
    # The place where the Registry will fetch the source from.
    # This is optional since you might want to release the code without
    # publishing to the Registry, which is what this is needed for.
    location:
      # There are a few supported locations:
      # 1) Github: no URL needed, just username and the name of the repo
      #    The `subdir` field is optional, and only necessary if your
      #    package is not in the root of the repo.
